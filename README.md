# NRCS-Engineering-Tools---ArcMap
USDA-NRCS Engineering Tools 2.x for ArcMap 10.x

As of the last update to this readme file, this version is still in development as a conversion from previous 1.x versions developed in ArcGIS 9.3 and held together through legacy compatibility. The conversion is focused on converting code to arcpy, making corrections, and streamlining processing. This toolbox will be replaced by an ArcGIS Pro version and is simply intended as a legacy ArcMap version.

A Python-based collection of tools for hydrologic and terrain-based analysis of high resolution elevation data ArcGIS.

ArcGIS Desktop Licensing:
All tools are built with Python and configured within ArcToolbox to be used within an active ArcMap Project. Most tools require the "Standard" (formerly ArcEditor) license level as well as a Spatial Analyst extension. Some tools that compute volumes also require a 3D Analyst extension.
